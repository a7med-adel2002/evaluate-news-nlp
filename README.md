# Evaluate a News Article with Natural Language Processing

## Description

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to evaluate news articles. By integrating the MeaningCloud API, the application analyzes the content for subjectivity, polarity, and other semantic properties. Built with modern web development tools like Webpack and Sass, this project also emphasizes best practices by securely managing sensitive API keys using dotenv.

## Features

NLP Integration: Uses the MeaningCloud API for text analysis.
Secure API Management: Implements .env files to protect personal API keys.
Modern Development Workflow:
Built with Webpack for bundling and optimization.
Styled with Sass for modular and maintainable CSS.
Custom Functions: Encapsulated logic into reusable modules for enhanced code organization.
Responsive Design: Improved user experience with styled HTML and dynamic content.

## Technologies Used

HTML5: Structured and semantic web content.
Sass: Modular and maintainable stylesheets.
Webpack: Module bundler for asset management.
JavaScript (ES6): Functional logic and interactivity.
dotenv: Environment variable management for API key protection.

## Usage

Open the application in your browser (usually at http://localhost:8080).
Enter the URL of a news article in the input field.
Click Submit to analyze the article.
